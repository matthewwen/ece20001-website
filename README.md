# Fall 2020 ECE 20001 Matthew Wen TA Website

The website uses next.js and next.js deployment / hosting service. It serves content to current students of ece 20001 at purdue university. I am currently the TA for that class, and this website will allow students to access content from piazza, brightspace, my notes, etc quickly.

## The Rules (Keep in Mind)
Content on the website is mine, not property of the school. I am not allowed to upload documents from Purdue University. If I do reference content from Purdue University, the website will navigate to a brightspace link. 

## Running the Application
Details of the commands are in package.json

```
# Running Development Version -> localhost:3030
npm run dev  [runs the development version]

# Running the production version
npm run build [builds an optimized version of code]
npm run start [start the build version]
```
